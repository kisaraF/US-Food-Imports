- Dataset contains the following information:
	+ Total Food category wise year by year changes in value ($millions) & volume (mt, litpf- proof litre, etc.)
	+ Food category wise year by year value and volume changes


- What can we do?
	+ Divide the dataset into separate categories: Food Volume by each sub-category (not as a whole)


Take the total column fro food value and food volume and combine it with the countries
For the subcategories take the other approach


Food Values total country wise (Done)
Food Volume (Only taking totals because there are no country wise values)
Food Volumes normalized version will use Min-Max scaler since the data distribution is right skewed
